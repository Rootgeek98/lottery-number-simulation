# Lottery Number Simulation

**Warning: This app doesn't warranty ANY damage or loss from using this app.**

## Intro

This app visualizes lottery number trends and predicts possible lottery numbers, all which are based on one real eastern Asian lottery data.

This app is written mainly in Python and R. Our Python code is for server side scripting whereas our R code for prediction algorithms and data visualization. In addition, we utilize Bootstrap for our cosmetic work and jQuery for client side application logic.

We implemented three prediction algorithms:

* Pick random numbers
* Pick high frequency numbers
* Pick low frequency numbers

To my best knowledge, there is **NO** truly reliable lottery prediction algorithm, or I will become a millionaire very soooooon.
